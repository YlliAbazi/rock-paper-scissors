# rock-paper-scissors

This is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game coded in Javascript as part of the TOP curriculum.

First it was only a console based game. Then we revisited this project to practice the newly learned DOM Manipulation and Events lesson. We added some basic UI functionality and now the game can be played in a more normal way.
